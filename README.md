For this analysis, sections of the data have been included in the MSA package.

Objective:
Imagine you are McDonald’s, aiming to determine if distinct consumer segments exist that have different perceptions of the brand. Understanding these systematic differences in brand perceptions by market segments helps to identify which segments to focus on and what messages to communicate to them.

Approach:
Positive Perception Focus: Identify market segments with a positive perception of McDonald’s and reinforce these positive perceptions through targeted messaging.
Negative Perception Focus: Identify market segments with a negative perception of McDonald’s. Understand the key drivers behind these negative perceptions and strategize to modify them.

Conclusion:
This case study provides insights into how McDonald’s can leverage market segmentation to improve its brand image and tailor its marketing strategies effectively.
